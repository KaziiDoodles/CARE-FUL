# CARE-FUL
Be careful about these people!!!

Hello ! An ex-Darkshipper speaking (i healed!!) So yesterday and today, i've seen Darkshippers in the Dandy's world area, 2 people with a toodles skin and 1 pebble.

So in the first toodles skin, they had the name "[Gigi kisser] , If u dont know, toodles is a **KID**, gigi is not, shes an **adult** (i dont Remember her age, btw its on the wiki) So dont interact with them, they might act nice but theyre actually disgusting.

Second toodles skin. In their name there was the dark shipper emoji combo, if u dont know how it looks like, there it is : 🎱🎀...
If u think the bow is just for making it pretty and even the ball, well its not, because they all said IN THE **PUBLIC** CHAT, "we love toodles x pebble !!!!" , so theyre all Darkshippers.

The pebble skin. In this moment i was playing pony town, and saw the pebble skin, i knew it was them. Theres "#Toodles kissr" in their name. i also have proof pics : <img width="1000" height="1000" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a6a4a81-f02d-4ea4-98f5-e0842ec77c25" /> , they have a github account. if u didnt knew this, unfollow them RIGHT NOW, as you can see, theres no "im a Darkshipper btw" , so they might trying to hide that and make ppl think theyre a normal person, BUT THEYRE NOT. if u didnt knew they were problematic its okay.

Dont interact with any of these people, u might get in a situation that u dont want to.

Please be careful!!!
